            <li class="a">A Web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds. As the crawler visits these URLs, 
                it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl <b>frontier.</b> </li>
            <li class="a">URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies. </li>
            <li class="a">If the crawler is performing archiving of websites it copies and saves the information as it goes.</li>
